Name: Luke Martin
Class: Itec 2150
Directions are as follows.
▪Create Bread superclass that has default constructor with general ingredients and recipe.
It also has a constructor with all the parameters. Bread also comes with getter, setter, and toString methods.
Besides those methods, the Bread superclass has the bake method to change the state of bread from "not baked" to "baked",
unless it is already "baked."
And also has getIngredients method.
This method returns a String of all the ingredients of the instance. And you can add other methods as you want.
There are five subclasses of Bread class. Each of them will have unique properties with unique ingredients.

–Instance variables: flour, water, salt, sugar, baking powder, yeast, breadName, state, recipe.
–Default constructor
–Constructor with all parameters.
–Getters, setters, toString method.
–bake, getIngredients, and other methods you want to include.
▪Create SourdoughBread subclass
–Instance variables: you will need to create unique instance variables for sourdough bread.
–Constructors, getters, setters, recipe method  to describe how to, and toString or you can add other methods you want to include.

▪Create Pastry subclass
–Instance variables: you will need to create unique instance variables for pastry.
–Constructors, getters, setters, recipe method  to describe how to, and toString or you can add other methods you want to include
▪Create three more different type of bread subclasses (e.g. SourdoughBread- see follow sample)
–Constructors, getters, setters, recipe method  to describe how to, and toString or you can add other methods you want to include
▪Main class.  This class has an instance of Bread and its subclasses. This program will display recipes of all classes and methods.

Grade: 
Each class has their own set of recipes and an override toString connects the original ingredients to each set of bread mixture
